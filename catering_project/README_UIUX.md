# UI/UX Notes (Swiggy/Zomato like)

- Clean card-based layout with strong imagery.
- Quick actions (Add to cart) visible on each card.
- Consistent CTA color (accent).
- Use lazy-loading images, category tabs, search, filters to mimic big food apps.
- Keep checkout flow short: Cart -> Address -> Payment -> Confirmation.
